# derby-d3-behaviors

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

This simple app shows how to make a [derby][derby] component out of a reusable
[d3][d3] visualization that makes use of [behaviors][behaviors].

The visualization was ported from the [canonical zoom example](zoom), with
some changes to handle being redrawn. A great introduction to this process can 
be found in the [general update pattern][gup] tutorials.

# Dependencies
To appease derby and racer, you'll need redis and MongoDB installed. If they 
are both available locally on default ports, this app will work pretty much out 
of the box.

All other dependencies are handled by `npm`. Note that the derby stack is under 
active development at this point, and this repo is just a demo... so it might 
break at any time.

# Usage
~~~~bash
npm install
npm start
~~~~

Navigate to the [local development server](http://localhost:3000).

# Limitations
There is no authn/authz whatsoever on the app, nor is there any validation of 
any of the data. As derby, racer and ShareJS mature, it should be possible to add both of these.

# Interesting areas of the code
Not much was modified from the skeleton created by ```derby bare```, aside from 
work done in the `ui` component itself, which could be mostly modified to suit 
your needs.

## Component
- [/ui/behaviors/index.js](/ui/behaviors/index.js): basically the controller, this module knows how to work with both the model and high-level d3 calls
- [/ui/behaviors/render.js](/ui/behaviors/render.js): the view, which passes information translated from screen coordinates back to the model
- [/ui/behaviors/index.html](/ui/behaviors/index.html): really just a shim
- [/ui/behaviors/index.styl](/ui/behaviors/index.styl): styling for the svg and html wrappers... a little messy right now

## App code
- [/lib/app/index.js](/lib/app/index.js): the controller
- [/view/app/index.html](/view/app/index.html): html wrapper

## Styles
- [/styles/app/index.styl](/styles/app/index.styl): base styles
